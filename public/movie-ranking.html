<h1>The Best Movies According to Pamela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Parent Trap</h3>
<p>I love Nancy Meyers movies and aesthetic. 
   I find them really cozy.
   Specially this one which brings me back to my childhood.
   It's a very nostalgic movie for me. </p>
<h3>Mamma Mia</h3>
<p>I love the scenografy. It transports me to Greece. Ever since I saw this movie, I've wished to visit. </p>
<h3>Nightmare before Christmas</h3>
<p>I consider it to be mainly a Halloween movie, which is not only the best holiday. But, it's also a Christmas movie, my second favorite. I love the songs and the animations are just intriguing.</p>
